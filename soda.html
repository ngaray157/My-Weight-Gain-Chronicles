                It originally started with pure sugar in it, but companies began to incorporate high
                 fructose corn syrup into it. Personally, I think sugar was better back in the day, 
                 it was more pure and not as sweet as high fructose corn syrup.
                  I still drink it though, even though it basically leads to Type 2 Diabetes.
                   Oh well, it tastes good so who cares.  It is totally worth the health problems.

                It kind of made me feel bloated at times, but that’s 
                mostly if you drink a whole bunch of it.
                 I think I may have Diabetes from this though, so watch out.
