                are the most perfect breakfast for anyone of any size.
                Recently I have been having them almost every day for breakfast,
                and sometimes even for lunch. These delicious sweets come in a variety of flavors,
                shapes, and sizes. The most common tend to be circles with the hole in the middle.
                Typically these have frosting on them, usually with sprinkles or some other kind of topping.
                My favorite ones are the elongated donuts.</p></section>

                 I’ve had some days where I’ve eaten them too quickly and ended up gettin
                 g explosive diarrhea for most of the day. It was disgusting, but it was 
                 worth it since the food was good.
