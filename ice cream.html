                 You can even get lower sugar and lower carb versions that taste just as good. 
                 You can get ice cream for vegans, but that ice cream is only for vegans who think using
                  animals for their actual purposes is terrible and no good whatsoever.
                   But vegans are not the topic of this blog, so let's move on! Anyway,
                    ice cream comes in (yet again) numerous flavors. Some flavors such as mint 
                    chocolate chip have small chocolate chips within the green-tinted ice cream.
                     I think ice cream is cool because it comes in so many different options.
                      Like, this dessert is probably the most popular amongst people since there are so 
                      many different ones to choose from. There’s something for everyone, basically.

                so if you’re sensitive to it, don’t eat it because 
                it will make you feel sick. Other than that, I haven’t had a lot of problems with it.
