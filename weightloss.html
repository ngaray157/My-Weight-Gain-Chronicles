                <li>Drink water</li>
                Drinking water increases your metabolism.
                <li>Eat eggs for breakfast</li>
                Eggs are high in protein and make you feel full quickly.
                <li>Cut back on added sugar</li>
                Sugar is the main source that adds fat.
                <li>Eat spicy food</li>
                They can boost your metabolism and slightly reduce your appetite.
                <li>Don’t drink soda or fruit juice</li>
                These drinks are full of sugar and are extremely unhealthy for you.
                <li>Eat a high protein breakfast</li>
                It can reduce carvings and calorie intake throughout the day.
                <li>Drink coffee and tea</li>
                The caffeine in coffee and tea can boost your metabolism but try to lay off the sugar.
                <li>Eat food slowly</li>
                It takes a while for your stomach to send the feeling of being full to the brain 
                so if you continue to eat food after you feel a bit full you are likely overeating.</li>
                <li>Get good sleep.</li>
                You burn calories in your sleep so don’t stay up playing video games or watching anime all night just to find out its
                4am and you are going to look like a zombie in school that day.
	            <li>Joining the Military and going to bootcamp </li>
                This is guaranteed to put you in shape but it is also the most difficult.
