            You know, since everyone has a birthday and who doesn’t eat cake for their birthday?
            People who don’t are uncultured swines, I mean what would you eat for your birthday…
            broccoli? I guess cupcakes are okay as a substitute, but cake is the best.
            There are continuous designs, colors, and flavors you can put into cakes,
            making it super easy to customize how you want your birthday cake to represent you.
            And best of all, you can get any size pieces of cake whether you want half the cake 
            or a very thin slice, its very easy to form the slice that appeals to you.  </p></section>

        <section id="passing"><p>Cake has never had effects on me. I have a lot of family 
            members so I get birthday cake 87% of the year. I can eat like two whole slices
             of cake and still not be full.
