                The most famous place to get these would be McDonald’s, obviously.<br>
                hese are very high in carbs, but they are tasty.
                The thing with burgers, is that you can customize them to any extent.<br>
                You can add lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, mustard, ketchup, and the list goes on and on.<br>
                My personal favorite would have to be a single with only cheese and mayo since I am not a big veggie fan.<br>
                Obviously that’s why I’m making this blog.</p></section>

            <section id="passing"><p>Unfortunately, burgers make me feel weird after I eat them.
                 I think sometimes I have acquired hallucinations afterwards. I’m not sure why,
                  but it’s not fun to go through so I do not eat them very often. When I do, I
                   regret it almost instantly. I tend to lean towards chicken sandwiches.
