                        Welcome to The Weight Gain Chronicles! This is a blog about different food-related guilty pleasures amongst people. 
                        Upon entering this website, do not feel bad about what you eat. 
                        This is where you can spill your dirty secrets when it comes to what you eat on a regular basis, 
                        your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with any kind of food. 
                        I will also be sharing different foods, my experiences with them and my recommendations for people with big stomachs. 
                        By the time you leave this site, you may have a big appetite so feel free to indulge on anything you see after logging 
                        off. The nearest McDonald’s, In-N-Out, or Chick-Fil-A may have the right thing for you!

                        I also linked some fitness and dieting apps, websites, and more as you go and explore this page. 
                        If you are feeling down in the dumps about what you eat, or even how much you weigh, 
                        those resources are bound to help you get to where you want to be. To be honest, 
                        who cares if your metabolism or health is absolutely awful, food tastes better and is so worth the mental misery! 
                        I mean you probably have Starbucks just down the street, so how about you head on over and buy yourself four cake 
                        pops and a trenta caramel frappe, and you’re all set.
